        <div> Speaking is B1 level and listening is C1. For upgrading my english skills, I prefer to Listening songs and at the same time read lyrics. And i have another trick
            is translate song lyrics. English is almost hobby for me, i like it so much and I have large vocabulary.</div>

    <section> <h2>knowledge's </h2> 
        <div> I know basics of OOP language like: C++, C#, JS, unity C#, a little bit of python. Some of backend languages: PHP,SQL .Also I create projects/games in game engines like: Unreal engine 5 and Unity Engine.
            On UE5 my project was 3D game with camera on top. It also has a landscape: grass, trees, rocks, sand. Character is Cartoon style robot with player controller.
            Unity project was more simpler. It was just casual 2D platformer where u jump over the objects and trying to not fall dawn.
