**About myself**

### Pre-history
A few days ago i started to study in RS school as beginner frontend developer. Before, i was finished college by IT speciality. 

And i understand that i need more hard skills, so i started to develop myself.

### Knowleges 
I know basics of OOP language like: C++, C#, JS, unity C#, a littlr bit of python. Some of backend languages: PHP,SQL .Also I create projects/games in game engines like: Unreal engine 5 and Unity Engine.

On **UE5** my project was 3D game with camera on top. It also has a landscape: grass, trees, rocks, sand. Character is Cartoon style robot with player controller.

**Unity** project was more simplier. It was just casual 2D platformer where u jump over the objest and trying to not fall dawn. 

### English skills
Speaking is B1 level and listening is C1. For upgrading my english skills, I prefer to Listnening songs and at the same time read lyrics. And i have another trick

is translate song lyrics. English is almost hobby for me, i like it so much and I have large vocabulary.

### Work experience in IT
